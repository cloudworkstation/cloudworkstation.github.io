* **Re-use first**: if somebody has already build something we need, we will use that first.  We only write our own code when we have to.
* **Layered Architecture**: each layer of the stack is well defined, with a specific role.  They are modular and easy to understand.  We can swap them if we need to.
* **Sensible defaults**: out of the box the platform has opinions on sensible defaults that will lead to typically useful outcomes for users.
